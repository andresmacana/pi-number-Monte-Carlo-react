# Generate the pi number with random numbers

1. npm install plotly.js

2. Run it! with npm start

The calculation is based on a `n` number generated randomly inside a `1 x 1` square.
A circle with radius 1 is inside the square.

Now the calculation of `pi` is as follows:
`pi = (4 * inside_the_circle) / n`
